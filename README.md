# A Play MEV bot


## TODO reads

- [ ] BowTiedDevil's analysis and dcoding of  Uniswap's [Introducing Permit2 & Universal Router](https://uniswap.org/blog/permit2-and-universal-router) at [Uniswap Universal Router" in substack's Degen Code](https://degencode.substack.com/p/uniswap-universal-router?utm_source=substack&publication_id=607913&post_id=106704127&utm_medium=email&triggerSave=true)

  Python classes to aid rapid development of Uniswap V2 & V3 arbitrage bots on
  EVM-compatible blockchains


## Why build a MEV bot?

This is purely a learning exercise on the following blockchain topics:

- Etheruem transactions
- DEX (Uniswap)
- Smart contracts

## And why code a MEV bot in Python versus Javascript?

- mypy gives you type checks
- asyncio gives you non-blocking event loop
- help other python devs since there are fewer Python bot examples online (most are javascript)
- this is easier to intergrate with future python based data science libraries such as pandas and numpy
- python is easier for me so I can concentrate on learning about blockchain rather than learning about new syntax
