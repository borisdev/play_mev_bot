## Why build a MEV bot?

You can learn about the following blockachain topics:

- Etheruem transactions
- DeFi (dex)
- Contracts
- Arbitrage

## And why code a MEV bot in Python versus Javascript?

- mypy gives you type checks
- asyncio gives you non-blocking event loop
- help other python devs since there are fewer Python bot examples online (most are javascript)
- this is easier to intergrate with future python based data science libraries such as pandas and numpy
- python is easier for me so I can concentrate on learning about blockchain rather than learning about new syntax
